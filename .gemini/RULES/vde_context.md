# VDE PROJECT CONTEXT
<!-- @forge (Governance Sentinel) -->
**Working Directory:** `~/VDE` | **Project:** VDE (Virtual Development Environment) — Docker-based container orchestration for 19+ language VMs with shared services.

## Session Startup (MANDATORY)
**Read `MEMORY.md` at session start** - before any other work. This is the single source of truth for project state, test status, and active work. See `AGENTS.md` section 1 for the full 8-step startup checklist. Skip any step whose content is already in context.

## Critical Architecture
- `lib/` — Core libraries (vde-constants, vde-shell-compat, vde-errors, vde-log, vde-core, vm-common, vde-commands, vde-parser) | `data/vm-types.conf` — VM definitions (data-driven, single-line additions) | `tests/features/` — BDD tests

## Shell Requirements
- **ZSH ONLY** - `#!/usr/bin/env zsh` or `#!/bin/zsh`
- **FORBIDDEN**: `/bin/sh` and `/usr/bin/env sh` are not allowed
- Features: associative arrays, process substitution, zsh 5.x

## User Model
devuser with passwordless sudo, SSH key auth only, neovim/LazyVim

## Project Portability (FUNDAMENTAL)
The project is **fully portable** - can be moved anywhere without regeneration. The default mandate is **Relative-Paths-Only** for host-side operations.

| Component | Location | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| `VDE_ROOT_DIR` | Derived from `bin/vde` | Auto-updates on project move |
| `VDE_SSH_DIR` | `$HOME/.ssh/vde` | Fixed, independent of project |
| Cache | `.cache/` | Contains only VM metadata (no paths) |
| Compose files | `configs/docker/*/docker-compose.yml` | Use relative `../../../` paths for build contexts |

**Absolute Path Exemption:** While the host-side VDE ecosystem MUST use relative paths for portability, **in-container paths** (e.g., `/vde/scripts/setup/...`, `/home/devuser/...`, `/var/lib/...`) MUST remain absolute, as the container filesystem structure is fixed and expects exact locations.

**Move project:** `mv ~/VDE ~/vde-system` → works immediately, no regeneration needed.
