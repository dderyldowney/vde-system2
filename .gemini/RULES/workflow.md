# DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW PHASES
<!-- @forge (Governance Sentinel) -->

## Pre-Edit Gate (MANDATORY — applies to ALL phases)

Before EVERY direct Edit, Write, or Bash call that modifies files:
1. STATE: "I am about to make [N] direct edit(s) to [files]."
2. COUNT: Is N > 1? → MAIN AGENT: YES = STOP, spawn coder sub-agent swarm. SUB-AGENT: YES = STOP, report back "This task requires >1 file edit. Split into a swarm or re-assign." NO = proceed directly.
3. AFTER: Run `/vde-enforce` to verify compliance.

This gate applies to ALL agents in ALL phases. Skipping the gate is a Rule 3 violation.

## Phase 1: Plan Mode
Entry: User requests implementation | Action: Use `EnterPlanMode`, analyze with sequential-thinking, generate step-by-step plan | Exit Gate: HARD STOP for explicit user approval | Violation Protocol: Proceeding without approval → STOP immediately, return to Plan Mode
## Phase 2: Code Mode
Entry: Plan approved | Action: Switch to Code Mode. Implement strictly in sequence | Swarm Gate: If >1 file change or >1 fix item → spawn coder sub-agent swarm BEFORE direct edits. Main agent must not apply >1 direct edit in a single batch. | Constraint: No unauthorized refactoring or optimizations | Violation Protocol: Changes beyond approved plan → Return to Phase 1, get approval for revised plan
## Phase 3: Audit
Entry: Code changes complete (Phase 2) | Action: Run `/yume--review` on all changes | Loop: If fails, use `/yume--iterate` to fix and re-run until CLEAN | Constraint: No git actions allowed during this phase | Exit Gate: `/yume--review` returns CLEAN (zero violations) | Violation Protocol: Git actions during audit → STOP immediately
## Phase 4: Code Review
Entry: `/yume--review` CLEAN (Phase 3) | Action: Run `code-reviewer` agent on unstaged changes (use `/vde-review` for full VDE-aware review) | Exit Gate: Requires BOTH `code-reviewer` approval and user approval | Violation Protocol: Proceeding without both approvals → STOP immediately
## Phase 5: Git Hygiene
Entry: Code-reviewer approval AND user approval (Phase 4) | Action: Verify tests, verify `/yume--review` CLEAN, verify reviewer | Commit: Use `/yume--commit` for verified commit | **Push: DO NOT push to origin unless User explicitly authorizes** | Exit Gate: Changes committed to repository | Violation Protocol: Skipping verification steps → STOP immediately
